# 2019 HTTP Workshop

**The fourth HTTP Workshop is on for 2019: 2-4 April in Amsterdam.**

This is a unique event; most of the time is unstructured, promoting unfiltered discussion among the major implementers and practitioners of HTTP. Each day will have a few "anchor" talks to stimulate discussion, but we expect attendees to drive most of the agenda. 

As they have always been, our goals are to:

* **Encourage** discussion and understanding between different parts of the HTTP community
* **Identify** areas of work or specific efforts that have common interest, to foster further work (in standards bodies and in implementations)
* **Ensure** broad input into future development of the protocol

See [previous years' reports](https://httpworkshop.github.io/) for an idea of what goes on.

## Who Should Come?

We anticipate most major HTTP implementations being represented, including browsers, servers, intermediaries, libraries, and tools.

In addition, we'd like to see active participation from practitioners at scale. If you work with large-scale HTTP deployments, whether that's serving "traditional" Web pages or using HTTP for back-end APIs, please consider attending.

This year, we want to **grow the diversity of our participants**. If you know someone who cares about HTTP, has made contributions, or wants to build their career around it, please tell us!

Finally, if you are a student working in a relevant area, this is a great opportunity to gain insight into this community.


## When and Where

The Workshop will be held in Amsterdam, Netherlands, 2-4 April 2019.

This year's Workshop is being generously hosted by [DATACTIVE](https://data-activism.net) at the [University of Amsterdam Department of Media Studies](http://mediastudies.nl). Thanks!


## Want to Come?

We have limited space (about 35 people), and want to make sure the discussion is valuable for those who attend. So, a program committee will select attendees.

Weâ€™re looking for people who can talk about things like:

* Data and insights about how HTTP is implemented and used
* Problems in existing HTTP implementations and/or deployments
* Ways to improve core aspects of HTTP such as performance, security, or reliability
* Useful extensions to HTTP
* Work on HTTP itself, with or without the constraint of backwards compatibility
* Their opinions about what the HTTP community should (or should not) focus its energy on

If this sounds like you, please send a statement of interest to the Program Committee. We'll use the statements to select attendees and to guide the content of the workshop itself.

You can include as much or as little information as you like in it, but the more context we have for who's interested in coming, the better. If you are the primary maintainer of an implementation of HTTP, please mention its details in your statement. If you have ideas about what topics the Workshop should cover (or not), we'd love to hear them.

Note that if necessary, we will limit representation from single companies and projects to assure balanced participation.

All attendees will be expected to adhere to the [Conference Code of Conduct](http://confcodeofconduct.com/). We will publish a summary of what happens at the workshop.

Please [make statements of interest using this form](https://goo.gl/forms/NyF9xJYdt97lCYrs1) by **10 January 2019**.
